- access networks

  The access network is the network that connects the edge device, those amazing edge devices that we saw in the previous video, into the first hop router, into the larger internet. In some cases, an access network connects a network, which called a home network, into this larger internet. 

- physical media
  - copper wires
  - fiber
  - radio

  That's actually used to transmit bits from the input side of the link to the output side of the link.
